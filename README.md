 <h2>Stability and Notes</h2>
 <br />
</div>
From what I know, the proxy is very stable. However, Cloudflare can limit the number of request (occasionally subrequest) to 50 for Non-Premum
Accounts, and does not support TCP (Meaning only UDP request get fully proxied) which is a Huge issue which i will hopefully patch with some Janky
solution.

 <h2>Quick Roadmap</h2>
 <br />
</div>

- [ ] Add TCP support (grab tcp in some other way and send it out as alt udp streams to the client, or just wait for them to add it natively???)
- [ ] Add Domain Mirroring ( Can access on alt Cloudflare domains for the worker, may already work?)
- [ ] Add Rate Limiting in editable JS File.
